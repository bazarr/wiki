# Asking for help or report a problem

Do you need help or want to report a problem or a bug? You can do that several ways.

- For a problem or question we suggest using [Discord](https://discord.gg/MH2e2eb).
- If you actually found a valid bug please use [Github](https://github.com/morpheus65535/bazarr/issues/new?template=bug_report.md) and perhaps report it also on  [Discord](https://discord.gg/MH2e2eb) providing a link to your Github issue.

## But before asking for help or reporting a problem

- Make sure you have searched the wiki and the especially the [[FAQ]](/Troubleshooting/FAQ/).
- Provide us with as much info as possible.
- Clearly describe the problem.
- Briefly describe your setup.
  - Including things like your OS.
  - Which version of Bazarr (System => Status => About).
  - Upgrade to the latest if possible.
- Tell us what you've tried already.
- Use the [[Logging and Log Files]](/Troubleshooting/Logging-and-Log-Files/) wiki article how to enable debug logging and where to find them, how to provide them !!!

!!! attention

    - **Don't use screenshots of log files.**
    - **Don't copy/paste log files in the channel without the use of [code blocks](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/210298617-Markdown-Text-101-Chat-Formatting-Bold-Italic-Underline-) we still prefer links pastebin or similar to the logs**.
    - **Don't just dump the `bazarr.log` in the channel, Nobody wants to download logs and open them in notepad!**
