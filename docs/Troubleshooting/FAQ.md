## I've installed Bazarr using Windows Installer and I'm stuck on version 0.9.1. What should I do

??? faq "I've installed Bazarr using Windows Installer and I'm stuck on version 0.9.1. What should I do?"

    Simply uninstall Bazarr (you won't lose your actual config and DB), download the latest installer from our website and install it.

    Make sure to adjust the service logon username and password if you did it previously.

## Where can I find the logs or database

??? faq "Where can I find the logs or database?"

    You can find the location for your database and log file in the following location depending where and how you installed it.

    **Windows Installation:** `%programdata%\Bazarr`

    **Dockers:** `/config/db` and `/config/log`

    **Source and other Installation:** `data directory inside bazarr root directory`

## This path doesn't seems to be valid

??? faq "This path doesn't seems to be valid?"

    If you're getting a error that looks like this:

    ![!This path doesn't seems to be valid](images/invalid-path.png)

    This can be for various reasons we've collected the the most common ones depending on the used OS.

    ### Windows

    - **Bazarr service runs under Local System account that won't be able to access network shares.**

        Run Bazarr's service as another user that has access to that share.  You need to change the account used for Bazarr service in `services.msc` console.

    - **You're using a mapped network drive (not a UNC path).**

        Change your paths to UNC paths (`\\server\share`) both in Sonarr, Radarr and Bazarr will be able to access those files.

    ### Docker

    - **Your docker containers volume paths don't match with Sonarr/Radarr**

        make sure Bazarr uses the identical volume paths as Sonarr and Radarr.

    ### Docker & Synology when mixing packages with dockers

    - In worse case scenario you need to make use of [Paths Mapping](https://github.com/morpheus65535/bazarr/wiki/Settings#path-mappings)

    !!! note

        *If you're using docker and get this warning and need help with it provide us with the docker compose or docker build command of Bazarr and Sonarr/Radarr !!!*

        *If you're using a system with a GUI(Synology, unRAID, OMV, etc.) to configure docker use one of the following from terminal(puTTy) to get the docker compose or docker build command.*`

         `sudo docker run --rm -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock red5d/docker-autocompose CONTAINER_NAME`

        *And yes this even works on a Synology*
        *if you don't know how you probably didn't read the [[Installation-Synology]](/Getting-Started/Installation/Synology/synology/)*

## I'm missing or want a subtitle provider added to Bazarr

??? faq "I'm missing or want a subtitle provider added to Bazarr?"

    You're missing a subtitle provider or want one added to Bazarr ?
    Well you got several ways to do that.

    1. The fastest:

        Learn Python and create a provider script for Bazarr.

        You can can look in the source code which [providers](https://github.com/morpheus65535/bazarr/tree/master/custom_libs/subliminal_patch/providers) we got and working on.

        If you need to write one then you can use the 2 following templates depending what the provider supports.

        - [API-Template](https://github.com/morpheus65535/bazarr/blob/master/custom_libs/subliminal_patch/providers/napisy24.py)

        - [Page-Scrapping-Template](https://github.com/morpheus65535/bazarr/blob/master/custom_libs/subliminal_patch/providers/soustitreseu.py)

        !!! tip

            If API is supported it is preferred.

            Why ?

            Easier Error management and Scrapping the site is more resource intensive.

    1. The slowest:

        [Bazarr Feature Request](https://bazarr.featureupvote.com/)
        First check if no one else already requested it of no one requested it you can create a new Feature Request, make sure to use a clear topic and use a good description and why etc.

        !!! NOTE

            **Keep in mind it doesn't mean it will happen, created or added !!!**

            **We highly discourage you from requesting providers in the Discord/Github.**

            **It will be ignored or forgotten !!!**

??? faq "Synchronization failed...."

    If you have left over `*.synced.*` files or if you get the following error or similar:

    `Synchronization failed; consider passing --max-offset-seconds with a number larger than 600`

    This Should be reported to [smacke ffsubsync Github](https://github.com/smacke/ffsubsync) by providing the subtitles synchronization debug log that is created by enabling `Subtitles synchronization debugging` in Settings-->Subtitles.
